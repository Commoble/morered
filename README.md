More Red is a minecraft mod that uses the forge modloader.

Built jars are available here

## Using the API

Mods can use More Red's API in a dev environment by including the following in their build.gradle

```
repositories {
	// java repo to get More Red jars from
	maven { url "https://commoble.net/maven/" }
}

dependencies {
	compileOnly fg.deobf("commoble.morered:${morered_branch}:${morered_version}:api")
	runtimeOnly fg.deobf("commoble.morered:${morered_branch}:${morered_version}")
}
```

Where
* `${morered_branch}` is e.g. morered-1.16.5
* `${morered_version}` is e.g. 2.1.0.0

You may need to add this to your run configs to use More Red in a dev environment:

```
property 'mixin.env.remapRefMap', 'true'
property 'mixin.env.refMapRemappingFile', "${projectDir}/build/createSrgToMcp/output.srg"
```

The API is only available on branches `morered-1.16.5` or newer and versions `2.1.0.0` or newer.

A debug jar is available with full sources for easier debugging, which can be used by compiling against :debug instead of :api. It is not recommended to compile against the debug jar when building production jars, as binary-breaking changes are more likely to occur with it.

More documentation of the More Red API is available on the More Red github wiki:
