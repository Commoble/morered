More Red adds the following [datamap](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/resources/server/datamaps/) types:

## Dimension Type

### Wind

A datamap is defined at `data/morered/data_maps/dimension_type/wind.json`, which specifies the wind levels observed by [windcatchers](@morered:oak_windcatcher) in different dimensions.

There are two valid formats for defining wind per dimension type, both of which are present in the default file:

```json
{
	"values": {
		"#morered:overworld_wind": {
			"min_y": 63,
			"max_y": 150
		},
		"#morered:end_wind": {
			"value": 2
		}
	}
}
```

The format used by the overworld specifies a min and max y; if a windcatcher's y-level is below `min_y`, its wind level will be 0.
If its y-level is above `max_y`, its wind level will be the maximum of 8.
Wind increases linearly from min y to max y.

The format used by the end specifies a constant wind value, which windcatchers in that dimension will have regardless of y-level.

The two tags used above only contain `minecraft:overworld` and `minecraft:the_end`, respectively;
additional dimension types can be added to those tags to make windcatchers function similarly in those dimensions.
