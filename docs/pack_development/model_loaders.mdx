title: Model Loaders

More Red uses several custom model loaders to load and bake models for certain blocks.

## Block Model Types

Custom blockstate models are used in [blockstate definitions](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Models#Block_states) (assets/namespace/blockstates).

### Wire Parts

The `morered:wire_parts` blockstate model type is used to generate protruding lines and convex edges for certain wire blocks, using neoforge's model loader APIs to allow a blockstate to have one of multiple different models based on world context.

The format of a Wire Parts blockstate model is as follows:

```json
{
	"loader": "morered:wire_parts",
	"line": { <line-model> },
	"edge": { <edge-model> }
}
```

Where the "line" and "edge" objects are the model jsons to use for the line and edge models, e.g.

```json
{
	"type": "morered:wire_parts",
	"edge": {"parent": "morered:block/red_alloy_wire_edge"},
	"line": {"parent": "morered:block/red_alloy_wire_line"}
}
```

This should generally be used in a multipart blockstate json to apply dynamic model parts to all blockstates:

```json
{
	"multipart": [
		{
			"apply": {
				"type": "morered:wire_parts",
				"edge": "morered:block/red_alloy_wire_edge",
				"line": "morered:block/red_alloy_wire_line"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

The line model should consist of a model on the down face of the block, extending from the north face to where the node model would be; the edge model should connect the west face with the down face.

| _Several [red alloy wire](@morered:red_alloy_wire) blocks, with convex edges and protruding lines generated by the wire part model loader._

Wire blocks also have "node" and "elbow" baked models that are rendered using the normal baked model system; nodes, elbows, and wire parts are merged together given a blockstate and world context using [vanilla multipart blockstate models](https://minecraft.wiki/Model#Block_states).

| _Several [red alloy wire](@morered:red_alloy_wire) blocks, with node models (left) and elbow models (right). Nodes and elbows are loaded and rendered using standard vanilla baked models._

Assuming a wire block uses the standard wire blockstate json format (consisting of all of the node and elbow models used together with a `morered:wire_parts` model in a multipart blockstate json), then the following rules are followed when generating the quads for a wire block at a given position in the world:
* Node models are to be defined by the multipart blockstate json for each interior face a wire is attached to
* Elbow models are to be defined by the multipart blockstate json for each pair of adjacent interior faces where a wire is attached to both faces
* For each of the four neighbors orthagonally adjacent to an attached node, a line model is generated if the node is allowed to connect to that neighbor block
  * A valid connector is defined as a block that allows redstone to connect to it and has a block support shape big enough for a 2x2 pixel wire to attach to it. [Redstone Dust](@redstone_dust) and all of More Red's wire blocks are overridden to have different connection behavior. Mods can specify connection behaviours for additional blocks via the [Ex Machina API](https://github.com/Commoble/exmachina).
* For each of the 12 edges inside the block, an edge model is generated if neither of the interior faces have an attached wire node, but both of the blocks adjacent to the edge are the same block as the central wire, and have wire nodes on the faces that that edge would connect.
  * Wire blocks will replace air blocks with an "empty" wire block when an edge needs to be rendered in a block where no wire exists; this empty wire block will revert to air when the edge model no longer needs to exist.

The Wire Parts model loader is used by the following blocks:
* [Red Alloy Wire](@morered:red_alloy_wire)
* All [Colored Cables](@morered:orange_cable)
* [Bundled Cables](@morered:bundled_cable)

### XYZ
The `morered:xyz` block model allows a block model part to be rotated on the z-axis, in addition to x and y (unlike the vanilla blockstate format which only allows x and y-rotations).

This is primarily used by blocks such as logic gates which can be oriented in 24 different directions, averting the need to have two separate model files (which would be required with the vanilla blockstate format).

Example from the [AND Gate](@morered:and_gate) model:

```json
{
    "facing=east,rotation=1": {
      "type": "morered:xyz",
      "model": "morered:block/and_gate",
      "y": 180,
      "z": 270
    }
}
```

## Item Model Types

Custom item model types are used in [item model definitions](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Items_model_definition) (assets/namespace/items).

### Logic Gate

The `morered:logic_gate` item model format has a format similar to the `minecraft:model` format, only specifing the ID of a model json. For example, the `morered:and_gate` item json:

```json
{
  "model": {
    "type": "morered:logic_gate",
    "model": "morered:item/and_gate"
  }
}
```

The logic gate item model sets [tint colors]($pack_development/tintindexes) for logic gate items such as the [AND Gate](@morered:and_gate) or [Latch](@morered:latch),
so that the item will be tinted in the same manner as an unpowered block.

### Windcatcher

The `morered:windcatcher` item model format specifies the ids of submodels used for [windcatchers](@morered:oak_windcatcher).

Using the oak windcatcher item json as an example:

```json
{
  "model": {
    "type": "morered:windcatcher",
    "airfoil": "morered:block/oak_airfoil",
    "airfoil_sails": {
      "black": "morered:block/black_airfoil_sail",
      "blue": "morered:block/blue_airfoil_sail",
      "brown": "morered:block/brown_airfoil_sail",
      "cyan": "morered:block/cyan_airfoil_sail",
      "gray": "morered:block/gray_airfoil_sail",
      "green": "morered:block/green_airfoil_sail",
      "light_blue": "morered:block/light_blue_airfoil_sail",
      "light_gray": "morered:block/light_gray_airfoil_sail",
      "lime": "morered:block/lime_airfoil_sail",
      "magenta": "morered:block/magenta_airfoil_sail",
      "orange": "morered:block/orange_airfoil_sail",
      "pink": "morered:block/pink_airfoil_sail",
      "purple": "morered:block/purple_airfoil_sail",
      "red": "morered:block/red_airfoil_sail",
      "white": "morered:block/white_airfoil_sail",
      "yellow": "morered:block/yellow_airfoil_sail"
    },
    "axle": "morered:block/oak_windcatcher_axle"
  }
}
```
* The `axle` field specifies the model id of the center axle:

* The `airfoil` field specifies the model id of the airfoils, which are rendered four times in the model:

![](https://commoble.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/morered/airfoil_template.png)

* The `airfoil_sails` field specifies a model id for each color. Four of these will be rendered, depending on the item data of the windcatcher:

## Model Loaders

Model loaders are used in [model definitions](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Models#Block_models) (assets/namespace/models).

### Rotate Tints

The `morered:rotate_tints` model loader is used to ensure that [red alloy wires](@morered:red_alloy_wire)
have the correct [tintindexes]($pack_development/tintindexes) when rotated by the wire part loader and the blockstate json.
It has the following JSON format:
```json
{
	"loader": "morered:rotate_tints",
	"model": {
		// inline model json object
	}
}
```

Tintindexes in a rotate_tints model loader will be transformed into other tintindexes if the model is rotated;
the tintindex assigned to each orientation is described in [tintindexes]($pack_development/tintindexes).
Currently, only red alloy wires use the Rotate Tints model loader.
