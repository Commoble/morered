More Red adds the following recipe serializers for use in recipe jsons.

## Soldering

Soldering recipes are used by the [Soldering Table](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/soldering_table). Soldering recipe jsons have the following json format:

```json
{
	"type": "morered:soldering",
	"ingredients":
	[
		{ <ingredient> },
		{ <ingredient> },
		{ <ingredient...> }
	],
	"result":
	{
		"item": <namespaced-item-id>,
		"count": <integer>,
		"nbt": <nbt-object>
	}
}
```

Where:
* `"ingredients"` is a list of Sized Ingredient objects
  * This can be a [vanilla ingredient type](https://minecraft.wiki/Recipe/Ingredient), or an ingredient added by other mods. Sized Ingredients may also have a "count" field, regardless of what type of ingredient it is.
* `"result"` is an object specifying the crafting result of the recipe, defined by the following fields:
 * `"item"` is the namespaced ID of the crafting result item, e.g. `"minecraft:apple"`
 * `"count"` is the stack size of the crafting result itemstack; it defaults to 1 if not specified
 * `"nbt"` is an optional NBT tag to apply to the output itemstack; it is ignored if not specified

Numerous examples of soldering recipe jsons can found in More Red's data files, such as [and_gate_from_soldering](https://github.com/Commoble/morered/blob/main/src/generated/resources/data/morered/recipes/and_gate_from_soldering.json).

Soldering recipes currently only support up to at most nine ingredients per recipe.

## Windcatcher

Windcatchers use a special shaped recipe to add color data to the result based on their ingredients. The simplest windcatcher recipe has the same format as shaped recipes:

```json
{
  "type": "morered:windcatcher",
  "key": {
    "-": "#c:rods/wooden",
    "W": "#minecraft:wool",
    "o": "morered:oak_axle"
  },
  "pattern": [
    "-W-",
    "WoW",
    "-W-"
  ],
  "result": {
    "count": 1,
    "id": "morered:oak_windcatcher"
  }
}
```

The recipe adds a a `morered:windcatcher_colors` data component to the result itemstack, which has the format
```json
{
	"east": "color",
	"south": "color",
	"north": "color",
	"west": "color"
}
```

Where "color" is any of the sixteen [color names](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dye#Color_values).

There are additional fields which can be in the root recipe object:
* `"north"`: Position in the recipe pattern of the item whose color will be used for the north value of the data component. Defaults to `{"x": 1, "y": 0}` if not specified.
* `"south"`: Position in the recipe pattern of the item whose color will be used for the south value of the data component. Defaults to `{"x": 1, "y": 2}`.
* `"west"`: Position in the recipe pattern of the item whose color will be used for the west value of the data component. Defaults to `{"x": 0, "y": 1}`.
* `"east"`: Position in the recipe pattern of the item whose color will be used for the east value of the data component. Defaults to `{"x": 2, "y": 1}`.
* `"default_color"`: Name of the color to use when a direction is absent or the ingredient at that position has no color. Defaults to `"white"`.

If an ingredient at the specified positions is in any `#c:dyed/<color>` tag (e.g. `#c:dyed/lime`), that color will be added to the result itemstack.

If the above recipe's defaulted fields were shown, it would look like this:
```json
{
  "type": "morered:windcatcher",
  "key": {
    "-": "#c:rods/wooden",
    "W": "#minecraft:wool",
    "o": "morered:oak_axle"
  },
  "pattern": [
    "-W-",
    "WoW",
    "-W-"
  ],
  "north": {"x": 1, "y": 0},
  "south": {"x": 1, "y": 2},
  "west": {"x": 0, "y": 1},
  "east": {"x": 2, "y": 1},
  "default_color": "white",
  "result": {
    "count": 1,
    "id": "morered:oak_windcatcher"
  }
}
```

## Windcatcher Dyeing

Windcatchers can be re-dyed after being created. This is defined via a single special crafting recipe with the id `morered:windcatcher_dye` which has the following format:

```json
{
  "type": "morered:windcatcher_dye",
  "ingredient": "#morered:dyeable_windcatchers"
}
```

![Shaped Crafting Recipe for Dyeing Windcatchers](https://commoble.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/morered/recipes/windcatcher_dyeing_recipe.png)

Similar to the windcatcher shaped crafting recipe, there are additional optional fields that may be specified:

* `"north"`: Position in the 3x3 recipe grid of the item whose color will be used for the north value of the data component. Defaults to `{"x": 1, "y": 0}` if not specified.
* `"south"`: Position in the 3x3 recipe grid of the item whose color will be used for the south value of the data component. Defaults to `{"x": 1, "y": 2}`.
* `"west"`: Position in the 3x3 recipe grid of the item whose color will be used for the west value of the data component. Defaults to `{"x": 0, "y": 1}`.
* `"east"`: Position in the 3x3 recipe grid of the item whose color will be used for the east value of the data component. Defaults to `{"x": 2, "y": 1}`.
* `"windcatcher"`: Position in the 3x3 recipe grid of the item being dyed. Defaults to `{"x": 1, "y": 1}`.

The recipe will copy the windcatcher ingredient to the result itemstack, replacing its `morered:windcatcher_colors` data component's colors based on any dye ingredients at the specified positions.

If an ingredient in the specified positions is in a `#c:dye/<color>` item tag (such as `#c:dye/orange`), that dye color will replace the original windcatcher's color.

If the player places the windcatcher somewhere other than the position specified by the `windcatcher` field in the recipe,
the other positions will be offset accordingly and stay relative to the 
This allows the dye recipe to work even in the 2x2 crafting grid.

With the optional fields present, the default windcatcher dyeing recipe would look like:

```json
{
  "type": "morered:windcatcher_dye",
  "ingredient": "#morered:dyeable_windcatchers",
  "north": {"x": 1, "y": 0},
  "south": {"x": 1, "y": 2},
  "west": {"x": 0, "y": 1},
  "east": {"x": 2, "y": 1},
  "windcatcher":{"x": 1, "y": 1}
}
```
