More Red adds the following recipe serializers for use in recipe jsons.

## Soldering

Soldering recipes are used by the [Soldering Table](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/soldering_table). Soldering recipe jsons have the following json format:

```json
{
	"type": "morered:soldering",
	"ingredients":
	[
		{ <ingredient> },
		{ <ingredient> },
		{ <ingredient...> }
	],
	"result":
	{
		"item": <namespaced-item-id>,
		"count": <integer>,
		"nbt": <nbt-object>
	}
}
```

Where:
* `"ingredients"` is a list of Sized Ingredient objects
  * This can be a [vanilla ingredient type](https://minecraft.wiki/Recipe/Ingredient), or an ingredient added by other mods. Sized Ingredients may also have a "count" field, regardless of what type of ingredient it is.
* `"result"` is an object specifying the crafting result of the recipe, defined by the following fields:
 * `"item"` is the namespaced ID of the crafting result item, e.g. `"minecraft:apple"`
 * `"count"` is the stack size of the crafting result itemstack; it defaults to 1 if not specified
 * `"nbt"` is an optional NBT tag to apply to the output itemstack; it is ignored if not specified

Numerous examples of soldering recipe jsons can found in More Red's data files, such as [and_gate_from_soldering](https://github.com/Commoble/morered/blob/main/src/generated/resources/data/morered/recipes/and_gate_from_soldering.json).

Soldering recipes currently only support up to at most nine ingredients per recipe.
