## Usage

The XNOR Gate can be placed in 24 different orientations, on floors, walls, and ceilings.

When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player, and the output side will point to the edge of the clicked face nearest to where the player clicked. A transparent preview is rendered to assist with orienting the block; this can be disabled in the [Client Config](/en/mod/morered/configuration/client_config) if this is undesired.

The sprint key can be held while placing the block to change the axis of rotation.

While both or neither of the XNOR Gate's input sides are receiving redstone power, the XNOR Gate outputs maximum redstone power from its output side. While one (but not both) of the inputs are receiving power, no output power is emitted.
