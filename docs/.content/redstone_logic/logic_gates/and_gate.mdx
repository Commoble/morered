## Usage

The AND Gate can be placed in 24 different orientations, on floors, walls, and ceilings.

When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player,
and the output side will point to the edge of the clicked face nearest to where the player clicked.
A transparent preview is rendered to assist with orienting the block;
this can be disabled in the [Client Config](../configuration/client_config) if this is undesired.

The sprint key can be held while placing the block to change the axis of rotation.

When all three input sides of the AND Gate are receiving redstone power, the AND gate emits a maximum-strength redstone signal from its output side. When any of its input sides are not receiving redstone power, no output power is emitted.
