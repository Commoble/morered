## Usage

The Diode can be placed in 24 different orientations, on floors, walls, and ceilings.

When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player, and the output side will point to the edge of the clicked face nearest to where the player clicked. A transparent preview is rendered to assist with orienting the block; this can be disabled in the [Client Config](/en/mod/morered/configuration/client_config) if this is undesired.

The sprint key can be held while placing the block to change the axis of rotation.

While the input side of the diode is receiving power, the diode emits a maximum-strength redstone signal from its output side. While its input side is not receiving redstone power, no output power is emitted.

| `facing` | `{"down", "up", "north", "south", "west", "east"}` | Direction to the neighbor block the plate is attached to
| `rotation` | `[0,3]` | Rotations about the axis of attachment in 90-degree increments
| `input_b` | `{false, true}` | Whether the input side opposite from the output is receiving power
| `waterlogged` | `{false, true}` | Whether the block is waterlogged
