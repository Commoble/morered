The Bitwise XNOR Gate is a two-input, single-output bitwise logic block, applying the XNOR operator to individual channels of bundled cable signals.

## Usage

The Bitwise XNOR Gate can be placed in 24 different orientations, on floors, walls, and ceilings.

When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player, and the output side will point to the edge of the clicked face nearest to where the player clicked. A transparent preview is rendered to assist with orienting the block; this can be disabled in the [Client Config](/en/mod/morered/configuration/client_config) if this is undesired.

The sprint key can be held while placing the block to change the axis of rotation.

Bitwise logic plates can connect to [Bundled Cables](@morered:bundled_cable), [Colored Cables](@morered:orange_cable), or similar blocks. For each color channel, if the Bitwise XNOR Gate is either receiving power from both inputs or not receiving power from either input, the output side will output a full-strength signal on that channel (equivalent to an == (EQUALS) operator on binary input).
[Red Alloy Wires](@morered:red_alloy_wire) will provide input signal to all sixteen channels.

## Data

| Blockstate Properties | Values | Description
| --- | - | -
| `facing` | `{"down", "up", "north", "south", "west", "east"}` | Direction to the neighbor block the plate is attached to
| `rotation` | `[0,3]` | Rotations about the axis of attachment in 90-degree increments
| `waterlogged` | `{false, true}` | Whether the block is waterlogged

| BlockEntity Data | Format | Description
| --- | - | -
| `clockwise_input` | integer | Bitflag [in wool color order](https://minecraft.wiki/Wool#ID) where the least significant bit is white.
