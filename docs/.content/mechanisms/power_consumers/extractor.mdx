## Usage

The Extractor can be placed in any of 24 orientations. Holding the sprint key changes the axis of rotation when being placed. A placement preview is provided to assist with placing the block.

The Extractor has an item input side, an item output side, and two mechanical power input sides.

Using the [Pliers](@morered:pliers) or another mod's wrenchlike item on an extractor will rotate it.
Holding the sprint key while pliering the block also changes the axis it rotates around.

While rotated by mechanical power, whenever a full revolution is completed, the Extractor will extract an entire item stack from the inventory its input side faces,
and eject the itemstack on its output side (into another inventory if possible).
