## Usage

In order to function, a stonemill must receive mechanical power via its top side, and have [water](@water) and [lava](@lava) and lava with a fluid depth of at least 4 next to the "grates" on two of its sides.

![Stonemill connected to water, lava, and a rotating axle](https://commoble.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/morered/stonemill.png)

The stonemill requires a large amount of torque in order to grind cobblestone. Using [Gearshifters](@morered:oak_gearshifter) can reduce the required power generated.

If the stonemill is rotated at least 1/32 rotations per second, and has both lava and water touching the grates,
the stonemill will generate cobblestone at a rate of betweeen 31 and 94 ticks per cobblestone, depending on how fast it spins.
To reach maximum cobblestone per second, a stonemill must rotate at 2 rotations per second.

The stonemill has a one-slot inventory which can be accessed by right-clicking it.

![Stonemill GUI with one inventory slot containing cobblestone](https://commoble.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/morered/stonemill_gui.png)

If there is an inventory such as a [barrel](@barrel) or [tube](@morered:tube) underneath the block, the stonemill will automatically insert its stack of cobblestone
into the inventory when there is no more room for new cobblestone (meaning [hoppers](@hopper) are not necessary to automate item transfers).

Wooden axles and gears are ignitable by lava, but using mechanisms made from [crimson stems](@crimson_forest) or [warped stems](@warped_forest) can avert this.

## Data

| Blockstate Properties | Values | Description
| --- | - | -
| `axis` | `{"x", "z"}` | Whether the grates are facing west and east, or north and south
| `enabled` | `{"true", "false"}` | Whether the grates are connected to sufficient levels of both water and lava

Blockentity data has the following format:

```json
{
	"morered:stonemill": {
		"progress": <int>,
		"gen_timestamp": <long>
	},
	"minecraft:container": <container>
}
```
| BlockEntity Data | Format | Description
| --- | - | -
| `progress` | integer | Value in the range [0, 63]. How much progress the stonemill has accumulated to the next cobblestone.
| `gen_timestamp` | long | Timestamp (in game time ticks) of when the last cobblestone was generated. Cobblestone begins generating again 30 ticks after this timestamp.
| `minecraft:container` | List of Itemstacks | See [vanilla container datacomponent](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_component_format#container). Only the first slot is used.
