## Usage

Windcatchers take up 3x3 blocks horizontally, and can be placed where enough room exists to place them (the center "axle" block will be placed at the clicked position).

![Windcatcher placed in an area just big enough to hold it](https://commoble.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/morered/windcatcher_placement.png)

Windcatchers can be used to power other mechanical blocks such as [Stonemills](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/mechanisms/stonemill),
[Extractors](@morered:extractor),
or [Alternators](@morered:alternator).

Mechanical blocks such as [Axles](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/mechanisms/axles) and [Gears](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/mechanisms/gears)
can be used to get power from one place to another. Windcatchers can connect to other mechanisms vertically (including other windcatchers).

![Several windcatchers stacked together and connected to axles](https://commoble.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/morered/windcatchers_stacked.png)

Windcatchers in the overworld generate more power the higher they are (scaling from minimal power at y=63 to maximum power at y=150).
They work best when there aren't too many solid blocks nearby horizontally.
Windcatchers also generate a small amount of power in [The End](https://minecraft.wiki/w/The_End), regardless of y-level.

How much power windcatchers generate is configurable per-dimension via datapacks.

Crimson and warped windcatchers are not flammable.

Windcatcher blocks have the following blockstate properties:

| Blockstate Properties | Values | Description
| --- | - | -
| `wind` | `[0,8]` | Wind level of the block. The higher the wind level, the more power the block generates.

Windcatchers are surrounded by eight invisible [technical blocks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Technical_blocks), which have the id `morered:airfoil`.
Airfoil blocks have the following blockstate properties:

| Blockstate Properties | Values | Description
| --- | - | -
| `segment` | `[0,7]` | Indicates which of the eight positions around the windcatcher the segment exists at.

Dyed windcatcher blockentities and itemstacks have a `morered:windcatcher_colors` data component of the format
```json
{
	"east": "color",
	"south": "color",
	"north": "color",
	"west": "color"
}
```

Where "color" is any of the sixteen [color names](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dye#Color_values).

If a direction is absent or the entire datacomponent is absent, the color will be treated as `white`.

Windcatcher blockentities have the same datacomponent in blockentity data:
```json
{
	"morered:windcatcher_colors": {
		"east": "color",
		"south": "color",
		"north": "color",
		"west": "color"
	}
}
```
