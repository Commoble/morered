## Usage

While the filter holds no item, it acts as a [Shunt](@morered:shunt).

Right-clicking the filter will open a menu with a single item slot.
While that slot holds an item, it will be displayed inside the filter,
and only items of that type can be inserted into the filter.

Using the [Pliers](@morered:pliers) or another mod's wrenchlike item on a filter will rotate it.
