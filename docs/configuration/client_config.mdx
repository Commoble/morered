title: Client Config
hide_meta: true
---

The client config allows client-relevant settings of More Red to be configured by specific clients.
The client config file is automatically generated at `<your minecraft instance folder>/config/morered-client.toml`
the first time the Minecraft client is launched with the More Red mod installed.
Changes to the client config file while Minecraft is running are automatically noticed by a file watcher, causing the changes to take effect instantly.

The following options are configurable:

| Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description
| --- | - | - | -
showPlacementPreview | boolean | true | Whether to render the render preview for blocks that have render previews
previewPlacementOpacity | float range: [0.0, 1.0] | 0.4 | Opacity of the render preview for blocks that have render previews

The default config file is as follows:

```toml
[Rendering]
	#Render preview of plate blocks before placing them
	showPlacementPreview = true
	#Opacity of the render preview. Higher value = less transparent, lower = more transparent
	#Range: 0.0 ~ 1.0
	previewPlacementOpacity = 0.4
```
