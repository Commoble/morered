title: Server Config
hide_meta: true
---

The server config file allows the configuration of settings which are synced from server to clients.
The client config file is automatically generated at `<your minecraft instance folder>/config/morered-server.toml`
the first time a client or server launches.
Changes to the server config file while Minecraft is running are automatically noticed by a file watcher, causing the changes to take effect instantly.

The following parameters are configurable:

| Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description
| --- | - | - | -
| max_wire_plinth_connection_range | Non-Negative Float | 32.0 | Maximum connection range (in block units) for blocks can be connected by [Redwire Spools](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_spool) or [Bundled Cable Spools](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/bundled_cable_spool)
| soft_tube_cap | Positive Integer | 400 | Soft cap on how many tubes can exist in a contiguous network of tubes. Items are transported slowlier in networks of greater size than this value, sigifying to the player that they have too many tubes.
| hard_tube_cap | Positive Integer | 500 | Hard cap on how many tubes can exist in a contiguous network of tubes. If a player attempts to make a network of greater size from this value, not all tubes in the attempted network will become part of that network.
| ticks_in_tube | Positive Integer | 10 | Base time in ticks that a moving itemstack spends in each individual tube block. Adjusted by other factors.
| max_items_in_tube | Positive Integer | 2147483647 | Max items that can fit in a single tube. A tube block will break if the number of itemstacks contained with them is greater than this value, dropping their items on the ground
| osmosis_filter_transfer_rate | Positive Integer | 8 | Osmosis filter automatic item transfer rate in ticks per item. The default value of 8 is the same as vanilla hoppers.
| max_remote_tube_connection_range | Non-Negative Float | 32.0 | Maximum range at which tubes can be remotely connected to each other. This also affects how many nearby chunks are checked for longtube intersections when placing a block.

The default config file is as follows:

```toml
#Range (in blocks) that wire posts can remotely connect to each other.
#Range: 0.0 ~ 1.7976931348623157E308
max_wire_plinth_connection_range = 32.0
#Soft cap on how many tubes can exist in a contiguous network of tubes. Items are transported slowlier in networks of greater size than this value, sigifying to the player that they have too many tubes.
#Range: 1 ~ 10000
soft_tube_cap = 400
#Hard cap on how many tubes can exist in a contiguous network of tubes. If a player attempts to make a network of greater size from this value, not all tubes in the attempted network will become part of that network.
#Range: 1 ~ 10000
hard_tube_cap = 500
#Base time in ticks that a moving itemstack spends in each individual tube block. Adjusted by other factors.
#Range: 1 ~ 72000
ticks_in_tube = 10
#Max items that can fit in a single tube. A tube block will break if the number of itemstacks contained with them is greater than this value, dropping their items on the ground
#Range: > 1
max_items_in_tube = 2147483647
#Osmosis filter automatic item transfer rate in ticks per item. The default value of 8 is the same as vanilla hoppers.
#Range: > 1
osmosis_filter_transfer_rate = 8
#Maximum range at which tubes can be remotely connected to each other. This also affects how many nearby chunks are checked for longtube intersections when placing a block.
#Range: 0.0 ~ 1.7976931348623157E308
max_remote_tube_connection_range = 32.0
