title: Server Config
hide_meta: true
---

The server config file allows the configuration of settings which are synced from server to clients.
The client config file is automatically generated at `<your minecraft instance folder>/config/morered-server.toml`
the first time a client or server launches.
Changes to the server config file while Minecraft is running are automatically noticed by a file watcher, causing the changes to take effect instantly.

The following parameters are configurable:

| Parameter | Type | Default Value | Description
| --- | - | - | -
| max_wire_plinth_connection_range | Non-Negative Float | 32.0 | Maximum connection range (in block units) for blocks can be connected by [Redwire Spools](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_spool) or [Bundled Cable Spools](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/bundled_cable_spool)

The default config file is as follows:

```toml
["General Settings"]
	#Range (in blocks) that wire posts can remotely connect to each other.
	#Range: 0.0 ~ 1.7976931348623157E308
	max_wire_plinth_connection_range = 32.0

```
