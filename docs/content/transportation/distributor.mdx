## Usage

When an item is inserted into one side of the distributor (via hopper, tube, osmosis filter, etc),
the item will instantly be inserted into an adjacent inventory on one of the distributor's other five faces.

If there are multiple valid inventories, the distributor will alternate between them.

If there are no valid adjacent inventories, the distributor will eject inserted itemstacks into the world.
