## Usage

Using the pliers on the side of a tube will store the position of that tube in the pliers.
Using this active pliers on a second tube will connect the two tubes and consume durability from the pliers.
Using the pliers on two connected tube faces will disconnect them.

The pliers can also be used to rotate many blocks from More Red (without consuming durability)
and will act as a wrenchlike item for other mods which allow it.

There is a maximum distance at which tubes can be connected to each other;
attempting to connect blocks farther apart than this distance will fail,
and half-formed connections will be cancelled if the player holding the item moves too far away from the wire post.
This distance can be set in the [Server Config](/en/mod/morered/docs/configuration/server_config).
