## Usage

Right-clicking the Loader will open a menu with a single item slot.
Inserting an itemstack into this menu's slot will cause the loader to instantly
eject the item from its output face.

If the Loader faces an inventory or item-handling block, it will attempt to insert the item into that inventory;
otherwise, the item is ejected into the world.

Using the [Pliers](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/transportation/pliers) or another mod's wrenchlike item on a loader will rotate it.
