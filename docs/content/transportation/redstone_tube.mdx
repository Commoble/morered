Redstone Tubes behave identically to [Tubes](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/transportation/tube), but also emit redstone signal when items pass through them.

## Usage

While items are travelling through the Redstone Tube block, the block will emit a weak redstone signal of strength 15.

![Redstone Tube emitting redstone signal](https://commoble.net/images/tubesreloaded/redstone_tube.png)

This signal will last the duration of the item's travel time (10 ticks on default settings).
If items are continually passing through the tube at a faster rate,
the signal will not cease until all items have left the tube.

## Data

| Blockstate Properties | Values | Description
| --- | - | -
| `powered` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the tube emits signal
| `down` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the tube is connected to the block below it
| `up` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the tube is connected to the block above it
| `north` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the tube is connected to the north
| `south` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the tube is connected to the south
| `west` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the tube is connected to the west
| `east` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the tube is connected to the east
| `waterlogged` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the tube is waterlogged
| `transform` | `{"identity", "rot_180_face_xz", "rot_90_y_neg", "rot_80_y_pos", "invert_x", "invert_z", "swap_xz", "swap_neg_xz"}` | Set when the block is rotated/mirrored by structure generation or similar mechanics; it ensures blockentity data is transformed accordingly. When placed by a player, this will always be `"identity"`

				List of the items currently travelling through the tube:
				* `item` is an itemstack object in standard vanilla format (with sub-fields id, count, components)
				* `moves` is the item's remaining moves encoded as a list of pairs of numbers [`dir0`, `count0`, `dir1`, `count1`, etc] where `dirN`, `countN` indicates `count` moves in the `dir` direction, where `dirN` is a direction ordinal in DUNSWE order
				  * e.g. [0, 5, 4, 2] indicates DOWN 5 blocks followed by WEST 2 blocks
				* `ticks_remaining` is the number of ticks remaining in this tube before it moves to the next tube
				* `max_duration` is the total number of ticks the item spends in the tube
				* `fresh` indicates the tube is the tube which the item was originally inserted into (as opposed to a tube the item travelled to from another tube)
