## Usage

When the extractor becomes powered by redstone, it will extract an entire itemstack from an inventory on its input side
and attempt to insert the stack into an inventory on its output side.
If no inventory exists or the item is not accepted, the itemstack is ejected into the world.

Once this occurs, the extractor will not extract any items until it becomes unpowered, and then powered again.

Using the [Pliers](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/transportation/pliers) or another mod's wrenchlike item on an extractor will rotate it.
