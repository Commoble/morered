Redwire Posts, Redwire Junctions, and Redwire Relays are blocks that can be connected to each other via a [Redwire Spool](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_spool) to transmit redstone power to each other across long distances.

## Usage

Redwire Posts can be placed in 6 different orientations, on walls, floors, and ceilings. When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player.

Redwire Posts can be connected to other Redwire Posts,
[Redwire Junctions](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_junction),
or [Redwire Relays](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_relay)
by using a [Redwire Spool](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_spool) on two such blocks sequentially.
Using the spool on two connected blocks sequentially will disconnect them.

In addition to sharing power with other wire posts connected in this way,
Redwire Posts emit and receive strong power to/from the block they are attached to.
When an input signal changes, all connected posts will update their power level simultaneously with wires.

## History
<table>
	<thead><tr><th>Version</th><th>Changelog</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1.22-7.0.0.0</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Rewrote how wires connect and transmit power; all wires in a network update at once instead of causing cascading block updates</li>
					<li>No longer loses power over distance; instead has a maximum network size (default 1024, configurable)</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1.20.1-4.0.0.0</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Added `transform` blockstate property</li>
					<li>`connections` are now stored as relative positions instead of absolute positions</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1.16.5-2.1.0.0</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Added "morered:redwire_posts" and "morered:bundled_cable_posts" block tags; added relevant blocks to these tags</li>
					<li>Stopped redstone dust from forming connections to logic plates and redwire posts on sides where the block has no input or output</li>
					<li>Fixed bug where redwire posts and redwire post relay plates weren't conducting power through solid blocks as intended (at this time they were intended to emit strong power)</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1.16.3-2.0.0.0</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Added Redwire Posts (without plates) and Redwire Post Plates (without connections to neighbors)</li>
					<li>More Red recipes now use tag ingredients instead of specific items in more places</li>
					<li>Trying to place a block where a redstone wire post wire is is now denied on the client in addition to the server (this will help prevent "phantom blocks" in high-latency situations)</li>
				</ul>
