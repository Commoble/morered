id: morered:redwire_junction
type: block

Redwire Junctions, Redwire Posts, and Redwire Relays are blocks that can be connected to each other via a [Redwire Spool](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_spool) to transmit redstone power to each other across long distances.

## Usage

Redwire Junctions can be placed in 6 different orientations, on walls, floors, and ceilings. When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player.

Redwire Junctions can be connected to other Redwire Junctions,
[Redwire Posts](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_post),
or [Redwire Relays](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_relay)
by using a [Redwire Spool](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_spool) on two such blocks sequentially.
Using the spool on two connected blocks sequentially will disconnect them.

In addition to sharing power with other wire posts connected in this way,
Redwire Junctions emit and receive weak power on their four sides orthagonal to the plate,
and can connect to [Red Alloy Wires](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/red_alloy_wire).
When an input signal changes, all connected posts will update their power level simultaneously with wires.

## History
<table>
	<thead><tr><th>Version</th><th>Changelog</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1.22-7.0.0.0</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Rewrote how wires connect and transmit power; all wires in a network update at once instead of causing cascading block updates</li>
					<li>Renamed from Redwire Post Relay Plate to Redwire Junction (`redwire_post_relay_plate` -> `redwire_junction`</li>
					<li>No longer emits or receives strong power</li>
					<li>Can now connect to bundled cables and bitwise gates</li>
					<li>No longer loses power over distance; instead has a maximum network size (default 1024, configurable)</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1.20.1-4.0.0.0</td>

				<ul>
					<li>Added `transform` blockstate property</li>

				</ul>
			</td>

		<tr>
			<td>1.16.5-2.1.0.0</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Added "morered:redwire_posts" and "morered:bundled_cable_posts" block tags; added relevant blocks to these tags</li>
					<li>Stopped redstone dust from forming connections to logic plates and redwire posts on sides where the block has no input or output</li>
					<li>Fixed bug where redwire posts and redwire post relay plates weren't conducting power through solid blocks as intended (at this time they were intended to emit strong power)</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1.16.3-2.0.0.0</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Renamed Redwire Posts to Redwire Post Relay Plates</li>
					<li>Added Redwire Posts (without plates) and Redwire Post Plates (without connections to neighbors)</li>
					<li>More Red recipes now use tag ingredients instead of specific items in more places</li>
					<li>Trying to place a block where a redstone wire post wire is is now denied on the client in addition to the server (this will help prevent "phantom blocks" in high-latency situations)</li>
