id: morered:redwire_relay
type: block

Redwire Relays, Redwire Junctions, and Redwire Posts are blocks that can be connected to each other via a [Redwire Spool](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_spool) to transmit redstone power to each other across long distances.

## Usage

Redwire Relays can be placed in 6 different orientations, on walls, floors, and ceilings. When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player.

Redwire Relays can be connected to other Redwire Relays,
[Redwire Junctions](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_junction),
or [Redwire Posts](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_post)
by using a [Redwire Spool](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_spool) on two such blocks sequentially.
Using the spool on two connected blocks sequentially will disconnect them.

Redwire Relays (unlike posts and junctions) do not transmit redstone signals to adjacent blocks;
they can only connect to blocks by being wired together with a spool.

When an input signal changes, all connected posts will update their power level simultaneously with wires.

## History

	<thead><tr><th>Version</th><th>Changelog</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1.22-7.0.0.0</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Rewrote how wires connect and transmit power; all wires in a network update at once instead of causing cascading block updates</li>
					<li>Renamed from Redwire Post Plate to Redwire Relay (`redwire_post_plate` -> `redwire_relay`</li>
					<li>No longer loses power over distance; instead has a maximum network size (default 1024, configurable)</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1.20.1-4.0.0.0</td>

				<ul>
					<li>Added `transform` blockstate property</li>
					<li>`connections` are now stored as relative positions instead of absolute positions</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1.16.5-2.1.0.0</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Added "morered:redwire_posts" and "morered:bundled_cable_posts" block tags; added relevant blocks to these tags</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1.16.3-2.0.0.0</td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>Added Redwire Posts (without plates) and Redwire Post Plates (without connections to neighbors)</li>
					<li>More Red recipes now use tag ingredients instead of specific items in more places</li>
					<li>Trying to place a block where a redstone wire post wire is is now denied on the client in addition to the server (this will help prevent "phantom blocks" in high-latency situations)</li>
