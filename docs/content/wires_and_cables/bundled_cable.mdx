Bundled Cable blocks can transmit redstone power on sixteen color-channels along floors, walls, and ceilings, and around corners.
They can connect to [Colored Cables](/en/mod/morered/docs/block/wires_and_cables/colored_cables), [Bundled Cables](/en/mod/morered/docs/block/wires_and_cables/bundled_cables),
and [Cable Junctions](/en/mod/morered/docs/block/wires_and_cables/cable_junctions).
They can also connect to [Red Alloy Wires](/en/mod/morered/docs/block/wires_and_cables/red_alloy_wire),
in which case signals will be transmitted on all sixteen channels.

## Usage

Bundled Cables can be attached to solid faces of blocks;
attaching a wire to a face consumes a wire item, and breaking that wire or the block that the wire is attached to causes a wire item to be dropped.

Bundled Cables transmit sixteen-channel power between themselves and other adjacent blocks capable of transmitting sixteen-channel power:
* [Colored Cables](/en/mod/morered/docs/block/wires_and_cables/colored_cables) will connect on a single channel
* [Red Alloy Wire](/en/mod/morered/docs/block/wires_and_cables/red_alloy_wire) will connect on ALL sixteen channels
* [Cable Junctions](/en/mod/morered/docs/block/wires_and_cables/cable_junctions) act as bundled cables, transmitting channels independantly 
Signals from different channels will be kept separate while passing through bundled cables.

Unlike redstone dust, there is no power falloff when power is being transmitted through cables.
Instead, there is a maximum network size of 1024 connected wire nodes (where a wire node consists of a block position, an attachment face, and a signal channel).
[Cable Junctions](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/cable_junctions) connected by [Bundled Cable Spools](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/bundled_cable_spool)
are recommended for long-distance signal transmission.

## Data

| Blockstate Properties | Values | Description
| --- | - | -
| `down` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the cable is attached to the bottom of its blockspace
| `up` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the cable is attached to the top of its blockspace
| `north` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the cable is attached to the north
| `south` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the cable is attached to the south
| `west` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the cable is attached to the west
| `east` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the cable is attached to the east
| `transform` | `{"identity", "rot_180_face_xz", "rot_90_y_neg", "rot_80_y_pos", "invert_x", "invert_z", "swap_xz", "swap_neg_xz"}` | Set when the block is rotated/mirrored by structure generation or similar mechanics; it ensures blockentity data is transformed accordingly. When placed by a player, this will always be `"identity"`
