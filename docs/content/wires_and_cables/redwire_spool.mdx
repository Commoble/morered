## Usage

Using a Redwire Spool on a block of the appropriate type will store the block's position in the spool;
using the spool on a second post block of the appropriate type will connect the two blocks.

| [Bundled Cable Posts](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/cable_junction) (left) and [Redwire Posts](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_post) (right) that have been connected by wire spools

Players cannot place blocks where the hanging wires are, and the hanging wires cannot be placed where blocks are.

There is a maximum distance at which wire posts can be connected to each other;
attempting to connect blocks farther apart than this distance will fail,
and half-formed connections will be cancelled if the player holding the item moves too far away from the wire post.
This distance can be set in the [Server Config](/en/mod/morered/docs/configuration/server_config).
