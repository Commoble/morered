Cable Relays are blocks that can be connected to each other via a [Bundled Cable Spool](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/bundled_cable_spool) to transmit redstone power on multiple channels across long distances.

## Usage

Cable Relays can be placed in 6 different orientations, on walls, floors, and ceilings. When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player.

Cable Relays can be connected to other Cable Relays or to [Cable Junctions](/en/mod_morered/docs/blocks/wires_and_cables/cable_junction) by using a [Bundled Cable Spool](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/bundled_cable_spool) on two such blocks. Connections can be removed by using the spool on the two connected blocks again.

Unlike Cable Junctions, Cable Relays will not connect to adjacent cables; only via the spool can they be connected to anything else.

				<ul>

					<li>No longer stores power</li>
					<li>No longer loses power over distance; instead has a maximum network size (default 1024, configurable)</li>
