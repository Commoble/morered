## Usage

Red Alloy Wires can be attached to solid faces of blocks;
attaching a wire to a face consumes a wire item, and breaking that wire or the block that the wire is attached to causes a wire item to be dropped.

All connected wires will share redstone power, and read and emit strong power to the blocks they are attached to.
They will also form parallel connections to redstone-emitting blocks which are solid on that side and at least as large as the wire
(such as [Redstone Cubes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block_of_Redstone) or [Repeaters](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Redstone_Repeater)).

Unlike redstone dust, there is no power falloff when power is being transmitted through wires (though one unit of power is lost when a wire receives power from redstone dust).
Instead, there is a maximum network size of 1024 connected wire nodes (where a wire node consists of a block position, an attachment face, and a signal channel).
[Redwire Junctions](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_junction),
[Redwire Posts](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_post),
and [Redwire Relays](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_relay)
connected by [Redwire Spools](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/redwire_spool) are recommended for long-distance signal transmission.


## Data

| Blockstate Properties | Values | Description
| --- | - | -
| `down` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the wire is attached to the bottom of its blockspace
| `up` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the wire is attached to the top of its blockspace
| `north` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the wire is attached to the north
| `south` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the wire is attached to the south
| `west` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the wire is attached to the west
| `east` | `{"false", "true"}` | Whether the wire is attached to the east
| `transform` | `{"identity", "rot_180_face_xz", "rot_90_y_neg", "rot_80_y_pos", "invert_x", "invert_z", "swap_xz", "swap_neg_xz"}` | Set when the block is rotated/mirrored by structure generation or similar mechanics; it ensures blockentity data is transformed accordingly. When placed by a player, this will always be `"identity"`

| BlockEntity Data | Format | Description
| --- | - | -
| `"power"` | Integer Array (6 values) | Array of the power value stored in each face (in DUNSWE order); each value has valid range [0,15]
