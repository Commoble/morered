Cable Junctions are blocks that can be connected to each other via a [Bundled Cable Spool](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/bundled_cable_spool) to transmit redstone power on multiple channels across long distances.

## Usage

Cable Junctions can be placed in 6 different orientations, on walls, floors, and ceilings. When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player.

Cable Junctions can be connected to other Cable Junctions or to [Cable Relays](/en/mod_morered/docs/blocks/wires_and_cables/cable_relays) by using a [Bundled Cable Spool](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/bundled_cable_spool) on two such blocks. Connections can be removed by using the spool on the two connected blocks again.

Cable Junctions can connect to [Colored Cables](/en/mod/morered/docs/block/wires_and_cables/colored_cables)
and [Bundled Cables](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/bundled_cable) to transmit signals on specific color-channels.
They can also connect to [Red Alloy Wires](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/red_alloy_wire), in which case signals will be
transmitted on all sixteen channels.

				<ul>

					<li>No longer stores power</li>
					<li>No longer loses power over distance; instead has a maximum network size (default 1024, configurable)</li>
