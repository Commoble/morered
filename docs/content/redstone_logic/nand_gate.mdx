## Usage

The NAND Gate can be placed in 24 different orientations, on floors, walls, and ceilings.

When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player, and the output side will point to the edge of the clicked face nearest to where the player clicked. A transparent preview is rendered to assist with orienting the block; this can be disabled in the [Client Config](/en/mod/morered/configuration/client_config) if this is undesired.

While all three input sides of the NAND Gate are receiving redstone power, the NAND gate emits no power. Otherwise, it emits a maximum-strength redstone signal from its output side.
