## Usage

The Pulse Gate can be placed in 24 different orientations, on floors, walls, and ceilings.

When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player, and the output side will point to the edge of the clicked face nearest to where the player clicked. A transparent preview is rendered to assist with orienting the block; this can be disabled in the [Client Config](/en/mod/morered/configuration/client_config) if this is undesired.

While the input side of the pulse gate starts receiving power, the pulse gate enters the `powered=true` state for two ticks. After two ticks, it enters the `powered=false` state. The pulse gate will remain unpowered until the input side stops receiving power and then starts receiving power again.
