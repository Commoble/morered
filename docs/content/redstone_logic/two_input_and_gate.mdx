## Usage

The Two Input AND Gate can be placed in 24 different orientations, on floors, walls, and ceilings.

When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player, and the output side will point to the edge of the clicked face nearest to where the player clicked. A transparent preview is rendered to assist with orienting the block; this can be disabled in the [Client Config](/en/mod/morered/configuration/client_config) if this is undesired.

While both of its two input sides are receiving redstone power, the Two Input AND Gate emits maximum-strength redstone power from its output side. If either of its two input sides are not receiving redstone power, the Two Input AND Gate emits no power.
