type: block
---

The Bitwise XOR Gate is a two-input, single-output bitwise logic block, applying the XOR operator to individual channels of bundled cable signals.

## Usage

The Bitwise XOR Gate can be placed in 24 different orientations, on floors, walls, and ceilings.

When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player, and the output side will point to the edge of the clicked face nearest to where the player clicked. A transparent preview is rendered to assist with orienting the block; this can be disabled in the [Client Config](/en/mod/morered/configuration/client_config) if this is undesired.

Bitwise logic plates can connect to [Bundled Cables](/en/mod/morered/docs/block/wires_and_cables/bundled_cable), [Colored Cables](/en/mod/morered/docs/block/wires_and_cables/colored_cables), or similar blocks. For each color channel, if the Bitwise XOR Gate is receiving power from one input on that channel (but not both inputs), the output side will output a full-strength signal on that channel (equivalent to a != (NOT EQUALS) operator on binary input).
[Red Alloy Wires](/en/mod/morered/docs/content/wires_and_cables/red_alloy_wire) will provide input signal to all sixteen channels.
