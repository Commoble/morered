## Usage

The Multiplexer can be placed in 24 different orientations, on floors, walls, and ceilings.

When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player, and the output side will point to the edge of the clicked face nearest to where the player clicked. A transparent preview is rendered to assist with orienting the block; this can be disabled in the [Client Config](/en/mod/morered/configuration/client_config) if this is undesired.

The multiplexer has three input sides, designated A, B, and C (the sides 90, 180, and 270 degrees from the output while facing the top of the block, respectively). While input B is off, the output side emits power while side A is powered. While input B is on, the output side emits power while side C is powered.
