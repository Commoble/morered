The XOR Gate is a block that outputs maximum-strength redstone power from its output side while one (but not both) of its input sides is receiving redstone power.

## Usage

The XOR Gate can be placed in 24 different orientations, on floors, walls, and ceilings.

When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player, and the output side will point to the edge of the clicked face nearest to where the player clicked. A transparent preview is rendered to assist with orienting the block; this can be disabled in the [Client Config](/en/mod/morered/configuration/client_config) if this is undesired.

While one (but not both) of the XOR Gate's input sides is receiving power, the XOR Gate outputs redstone power at maximum strength. While neither or both of the input sides are powered, the XOR Gate does not output power.
