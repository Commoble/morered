## Usage

The NOT Gate can be placed in 24 different orientations, on floors, walls, and ceilings.

When placing the block, the flat side will be placed against the face clicked by the player, and the output side will point to the edge of the clicked face nearest to where the player clicked. A transparent preview is rendered to assist with orienting the block; this can be disabled in the [Client Config](/en/mod/morered/configuration/client_config) if this is undesired.

While the input side of the NOT Gate is not receiving power, the NOT Gate emits a maximum-strength redstone signal from its output side; if the input side is powered, then the NOT Gate does not output power.
